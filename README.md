# Potato-Disease-Classifier

## Step 1: Setting up the Project
Start by creating a new Create ML project in Xcode. Choose the "Image Classifier" template, as it suits our classification task. Once the project is set up, we can proceed with importing our dataset.

## Step 2: Dataset Preparation
Our dataset contains three classes: "healthy," "early blight," and "late blight." Ensure that your dataset is well-organized with labeled folders for each class. Split the data into three sets: training, testing, and validation data. This ensures that our model is trained on one set, tested on another, and validated on a third, making it more robust. Here, you can just split in training data & test data because the validation data will be auto generated by createML

## Step 3: Determining the number of Iteration
Based on the Dataset you have, you can set the number of iterations. In my case, the dataset was not that balanced, that's why I used less iterations.

## Step 4: Training and Evaluation
Now, let's move on to the training phase. With the training data prepared, use the Create ML interface to initiate the training process. This may take some time depending on the size of your dataset and the complexity of the model.

Once the training is complete, we can evaluate the model's performance using the testing data. Accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics will give us insights into how well the model can generalize to unseen data.

## Step 5: Model Preview and Testing
To ensure the model works as intended, we can preview it in Create ML's interface. This allows us to input test images and observe the model's predictions. This step is crucial for identifying potential issues and making improvements if necessary.

## Step 6: Exporting the ML Model
Once we are satisfied with the model's performance, we can proceed to export it in the Core ML format. Core ML enables seamless integration of the model into iOS and macOS apps, making it accessible to end-users.
